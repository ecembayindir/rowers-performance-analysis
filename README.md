    <p>The files contain data collected during an ergometer competition (rowing machine). The competition is organized as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Each series has 4 rowers who will row 2000 virtual meters on their machines.</li>
        <li>The goal is to be as fast as possible over the 2000 meters.</li>
        <li>Data for each series is recorded by the machines and collected.</li>
        <li>The races are configured so that each 2000m course is divided into four 500m segments.</li>
        <li>Statistics provided by the ergometers are calculated and recorded every 500m.</li>
        <li>Each file in the zip corresponds to one race series.</li>
    </ul>
